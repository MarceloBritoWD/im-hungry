## Running localy
In order to run it locally you'll need to install some dependencies and a basic server setup. You i'll need nodeJS, GulpJS and Bower Installed.

1 - Install npm dependencies

 ```sh
    $ npm install
 ```
 
2 - Install bower dependencies
 ```sh
    $ bower install
 ```
 
3 - Run the app
 ```sh
    $ gulp
 ```

Obs.: Of Course, you can just up a simple web server http. But the app will run without BrowserSync.
