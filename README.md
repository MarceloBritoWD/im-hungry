# I'm Hungry project

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Angular 1.6
- Bootstrap Grid
- Stylus Pre-Processor
- BrowserSync
- Bower
- NPM


## Running
In order to run it locally you'll need to install some dependencies and a basic server setup. You i'll need nodeJS, GulpJS and Bower Installed.

1 - Install npm dependencies

 ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```
2 - Install bower dependencies
 ```sh
    $ bower install
    ```
3 - Run the app
 ```sh
    $ gulp
    ```

Of Course, you can just up a simple web server http. But the app will run without BrowserSync.
